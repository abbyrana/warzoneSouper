Google Collab Notebook Link: https://colab.research.google.com/github/abbyrana/warzoneSouper/blob/main/WarzoneSoupMT.ipynb

*   Extracted data of 1500+ weapon attachments in Call of Duty Warzone from [GAme8](https://game8.co/games/Modern-Warfare-3/archives/431902) via web scraping using [BeautifulSoup4](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) python library.
*   Extracted list of all compatible weapons for all 1500+ attachments in a very small amount of time by applying the concept of [Multithreading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html).
*   Built an app on Google [AppSheet](https://about.appsheet.com/home/) which  manages attachment inventory and ranks the best guns which unlock the most best attachments.
*   Created database on Google Sheets which is used by the app.
